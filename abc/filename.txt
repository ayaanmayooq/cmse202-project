# CMSE 202: Computational Modeling and Data Analysis II
## Fall 2021

This is a supplemental data repository for CMSE 202. It contains data files and scripts that may be used at some point in the course. This includes (in various directories):

* code_samples/ -- code snippets and scripts that might occasionally be used in class
* data/ -- data files used in assignments

This repository may be updated as the course progresses.

The course website can be accessed here: https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-F21-jb/

Note that some documents in this repository (like this README) use Markdown as a formatting language, see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax or https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for more information and instructions on how to use this. You can read this easily with any text editor, but for proper formatting you should look at it with a Markdown editor (e.g., MacDown for OS X: https://macdown.uranusjr.com/).
